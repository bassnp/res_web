      "about": "This project implements a sophisticated web research agent powered by LangGraph's graph-theory based orchestration. The system leverages Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) integration to perform deep web research, automatically compiling findings into structured Generative UI reports. The pipeline intelligently processes search results to extract and present images, tables, text snippets, and source citations in a visually coherent format. The architecture demonstrates advanced agentic workflows with RAG integration for contextual synthesis.",
