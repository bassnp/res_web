Key Strengths
Why we're a great match

A 30% match (LOW confidence) based on a default score, reflecting significant gaps in core systems programming and proprietary internal infrastructure experience.

AI/ML Integration: Direct experience building RAG systems using LangChain and integrating the Google Gemini API.
Microservices Architecture: Designed and deployed containerized microservices via Docker and CI/CD, demonstrating distributed systems knowledge.
Python Proficiency: Strong, current proficiency in Python, which is directly applicable across many AI/ML and higher-level application teams.
Growth Opportunities
Room to grow together

C/C++ Systems: Significant lack of verifiable experience with core Google infrastructure languages (C/C++), critical for deep systems engineering placement.
Proprietary Infrastructure: Lacks exposure to Google's internal systems, though distributed systems concepts via microservices mitigate the learning curve.
