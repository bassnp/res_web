      "description": "As part of my Senior Graduation Project, I teamed up with 6 other computer science engineers to develop and deploy a platform to build website and mobile pages to dynamiclly customize features for a client.",
      "about": "ChurchLink is a comprehensive church management platofrm developed for senior project graduation requirement with a team of 6 other students to from a strong bond as a team to offer a robust and user-friendly software deliverable. The platform provides an intuitive web and app features for churches to create and customize their digital presence across multiple platforms. Key features include localization for multi-language congregations, administrative dashboards for content management, and integrated PayPal payment processing for donations and events. The solution was successfully handed off to our client at Second Slavic Baptist Church as of December 2025.",

      "about": "In this project I set out to create a sophisticated web research agent powered by LangGraph's graph-theory based orchestration to leverage Google's Custom Search Engine (CSE) to perform deep web analysis and research, systematically compiling accurate context into structured Generative UI reports. The architecture demonstrates my passion for building agents and workflows with Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate and nuanced web searching capabilities.",

      "about": "Zharvis is a next-gen gaming companion built on the Overwolf SDK to serve an overlay for any videogame. The current Version 2 utilizes dockerized pods for horizontal scaling to provide a LangChain pipeline with Custom Search Engines for videogame Wikis and Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to have Gemini AI models build a Generative UI HUD with interactive windows and popups. The first iteration pioneered an archaic demo RAG workflow processing 15,000+ scraped wiki documents through vector stores with embedding and indexing for fast and efficient retrieval - however at the downside of accuracy. Now, the system enables gamers to access game knowledge without leaving their session or tab out of their game.",
